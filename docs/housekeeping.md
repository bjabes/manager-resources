Miscellanious but important info

## Feedback for me

I realize that as a manager there is a power imbalance between us. I do my best to [create a healthy environment for two way feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bDV_Ciffn0) and I hope that you will feel comfortable speaking to me about feedback in our daily stand ups, async/sync retrospectives, 1:1s, anonymous Q&A forms, and performance reviews. However, I recognize that it's not easy to do so! **Please feel free to speak to my manager if you have any feedback about my performance that you don't feel comfortable telling me.** You can also tell your teammates if you feel comfortable doing so, and hopefully they will pass it along to me.


## Availability

I am a strong believer in work/life equlibrium. Sometimes we need to sprint, but rest should always be worked into the schedule afterwards. **I do not expect you to respond to pings (with the exception of oncall rotation) unless it is normal business hours in your time zone.** I highly discourage working on the weekend! (side projects are ok) I will not respond to pings on the weekend or during the evenings unless it's urgent. I encourage everyone to take liberal use of the Do Not Disturb feature. Remember: newer teammates may feel they need to work on weekends if they see you doing it!

## Expenses and Requests

I prefer to be asked about days off. And please ask about expenses that seem out of the ordinary (ie- expensive or not easily/recognizably related to work). (shamelessly lifted from @asheren's README)
