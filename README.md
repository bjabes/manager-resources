# How does Danielle even

Welcome to my README! I've heard that my passion can be a bit intimidating if you don't know me, so I wrote this README in hopes to help you understand how best to work with me. I care deeply about the work I do and the people on my team and I want to help you be your best self and do your best work.

## TLDR
I believe in doing the right thing. I believe in collaborative teams without bullies. I love to ship things quickly and iteratively. I love to learn and to teach. I value context. I will help you become the best person you can be if you let me. I value the safety of the marginalized over the hurt feelings of the privileged. I'm an introvert. I recommend reading [Radical Candor](https://www.blinkist.com/en/books/radical-candor-en/) to understand my feelings on *compassionate* feedback and watching [Ted Lasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Lasso) and [Fresh Off the Boat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_Off_the_Boat) (seasons 1-4) to understand my motivations for running a team and Lara Hogan's [Resilient Management](https://abookapart.com/products/resilient-management) to understand my communication style.

Check out my thoughts on [goals](https://medium.com/@tsunamino/setting-goals-with-your-engineers-that-dont-completely-suck-cb76b87e4275) and how to run effective 1:1s and [how to run emotionally intelligent engineering teams](https://pbell.wistia.com/medias/k8htv3947p) ([podcast version](https://fellow.app/supermanagers/danielle-leong-github-ask-versus-guess-culture/)).
