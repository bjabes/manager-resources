# Staff engineer 1:1s 

Staff engineers require a bit more high level questions in order to maximize time together and see what needs help in your organization that you may not be seeing. These heavily inspired by this [great article](https://leaddev.com/culture-engagement-motivation/how-slowly-build-trust-your-staff-engineers) and [Plucky 1:1 cards](https://shop.beplucky.com/products/the-plucky-1-1-starter-pack).

- How do you spend your time? And given how you spend your time, what gives you energy vs what drains your energy?
- How do you scale your impact? What strategies are you working on to scale your impact as a very senior engineer within the org? Are there engineers that you’d like to grow to be the next in line, etc?
- Are there any technical decisions that came back to haunt us?
- Is there misalignment anywhere? 
- We’re always trying to do the best thing when we innovate and evolve our platform; is there a role or position that you would like us to hire to help you ‘be the best’?
- Are there any interesting documents that outline recent retrospectives or incident post-mortems that I should read up on?
- What can we do now that would make our lives better in six months?
- How can I help? 
- Who is the most stressed out person in the team/org? 
- What has worked well in the past? 
- If you had a month to fix whatever you wanted, what would you fix? 
- How is morale on the team?
- Is it clear what your role is on the team? In the engineering org? 
- Do you feel like it's clear how to succeed as a staff engineer in the wider engineering organization?
