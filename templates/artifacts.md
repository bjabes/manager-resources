# Artifacts 

The purpose of an artifact doc is to be a shared document with a manager and direct report that is regularly updated throughout the week. Using the goals that were agreed upon in the beginning of the quarter, there should be ~3 sections that the report should be working on in a given time space. 

The great thing about artifact docs are they provide a visible reminder of successes throughout the quarter for individuals, can quickly showcase what goal needs more work or needs refinement, and is a great shortcut for review season that combats recency bias :) 

## Goal
This should be an objective goal that you want to work on this quarter. Ideally it should relate to the engineering level that you're at or want to reach towards. Examples can be: 

- Participate more in technical decisions 
- Demonstrate autonomy in decision making for small to medium sized tasks
- Improve collaboration with teammates or outside teams
- Demonstrate leadership and communication skills across teams

Under each goal should be a running list of examples (preferably linked to the original source) in chronological order. Subsequent quarters can be added above the past quarter to provide a running list of accomplishments that can easily be used during bi-annual review time.
